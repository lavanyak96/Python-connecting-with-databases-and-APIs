    "Differentiation between SQL (Relational) databases and NoSQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Relational) Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Data Structure: SQL databases are based on the relational model, which means they store data in tables with rows and columns. The relationships between tables are defined using keys, such as primary keys and foreign keys.\n",
    "2.Query Language: SQL databases use SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and manipulating data. SQL is a powerful language for complex queries and transactions.\n",
    "3.Scaling: SQL databases are typically vertically scalable, which means you can increase the server's processing power (CPU, RAM) to handle more load. Horizontal scaling (adding more servers) can be challenging.\n",
    "4.Use Cases: SQL databases are well-suited for applications with structured data and complex relationships, such as financial systems, e-commerce platforms, and applications that require transactional consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Data Structure: NoSQL databases can store data in various formats, including document-oriented, key-value, column-family, and graph formats. They are schema-less, meaning each document or record in a collection can have a different structure.\n",
    "2.Query Language: NoSQL databases often use query languages specific to their data model. For example, document-oriented databases may use JSON-based queries.\n",
    "3.Scaling: NoSQL databases are designed for horizontal scalability, which means you can add more servers to handle increasing data and traffic. They are well-suited for distributed and cloud-based architectures.\n",
    "4.Use Cases: NoSQL databases are commonly used in web applications, IoT systems, real-time analytics, and scenarios where data volumes are large and rapidly changing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific needs of your application. SQL databases are suitable for structured data with complex relationships, while NoSQL databases offer flexibility and scalability for applications with dynamic data requirements and high traffic loads."
